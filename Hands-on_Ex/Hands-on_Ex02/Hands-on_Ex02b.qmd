## **5.1 Overview**

Second-order spatial point pattern analysis examines the spatial relationships between points in a pattern, specifically focusing on how the presence of one point influences the location of others. It goes beyond simply describing the overall density of points (first-order effects) by investigating clustering, dispersion, or randomness at various spatial scales.

Using appropriate functions of [spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/), this hands-on exercise aims to discover the spatial point processes of childecare centres in Singapore.

The specific questions we would like to answer are as follows:

-   are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?

-   if the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?

## **5.2 The data**

To provide answers to the questions above, two data sets will be used. They are:

-   *Child Care Services* data from data.gov.sg, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres.

-   *Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)*, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2019 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data.

Both data sets are available at [Singapore’s open data portal](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/data.gov.sg). They are provided in kml and geojson format. Students are free to download their preferred data format.

## **5.3 Installing and Loading the R packages**

In this hands-on exercise, three R packages will be used, they are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.

-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a family of R packages designed for modern data science. These packages are developed to work together seamlessly, sharing a common design philosophy, grammar, and data structures, which aims to make data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in R more intuitive and efficient.

Use the code chunk below to install and launch the five R packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## **5.4 Data Import and Preparation**

The processes of importing and preparing the geospatial data to meet the analysis are similar to Chapter 4. Please refer to the following sub-sections, if necessary:

-   [Importing and Wrangling Geospatial Data Sets](file:///C:/tskam/r4gdsa/_book/chap04.html#importing-and-wrangling-geospatial-data-sets)

-   [Geospatial Data wrangling](file:///C:/tskam/r4gdsa/_book/chap04.html#geospatial-data-wrangling) for preparing geospatial data in ppp object class required by spatstat package.
